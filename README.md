# openGLearning
This is just me following the course set forth by "learnopengl.com", and experimenting along the way.

  If you compile this currently (de85c75), you'll see a cat texture with transparency over a provided wooden crate texture from the course.
  The cat will be changing color over time, and the polygon this is all on will be rotating in the corner.
  You can press W for wireframe mode, F to swap back to the normal mode, and D/E to rotate it faster in different directions.
    The rotation was done quickly by multiplying the input variable by time to ensure that the program still looks like it's doing something with no input, so don't worry about the weird effects.
